TDR (Time-Domain Reflectometry) is used to diagnose Ethernet cable faults such as open circuits, 
shorts, bad crimps, or cable length issues.

Use only on supported switches (e.g., 2960, 3560, 3650, etc.).
The interface must be in down or non-connected state on some platforms for the test to run.

Useful for identifying:
Cable breaks (open)
Shorts
Cable length
Improper terminations
