Network Architecture Documentation â€“ Multi-Site Visio Design
Designed and documented detailed Visio architecture diagrams for over 300+ sites.

Mapped Cisco switches, Aruba Access Points, and associated IP subnets clearly across each site.

Captured physical and logical topology, including uplink connectivity, redundancy paths, AP placements, and VLAN distribution.

Ensured that each diagram provided a standardized, scalable reference for site deployments and troubleshooting.

Diagrams served as a central reference for the network, helping cross-functional teams in:

Onboarding new hardware

Validating site connectivity

Planning firmware upgrades

Troubleshooting escalated issues

Contributed significantly to streamlining operations and reducing errors by maintaining clear visibility into infrastructure layout.
